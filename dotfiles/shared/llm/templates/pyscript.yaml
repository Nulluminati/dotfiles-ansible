  Write a python script to be executed using the `uv` tool with inline dependencies.
  
  They always start with this comment:
  ```python
    # /// script
    # requires-python = \">=3.12\"
    # ///
  ```

  These files can include dependencies on libraries such as Click. If they do, 
  those dependencies are included in a list like this one in that same comment (here showing two dependencies):
  ```python
  # /// script
  # requires-python = \">=3.12\"
  # dependencies = [
  #     \"click\",
  #     \"sqlite-utils\",
  # ]
  # ///
  ```
  
  The code should have comments throughout and usage instructions should be included at the top of the file.
  This script will be run with `uv run`.
  Don't add fluff. No yapping, no markdown, no fenced code.

  Return only the python script and nothing else.
  The output will be piped directly into a file from which it will be run, 
  additional commenetary outside of the script itself would break this.
