  Write a descriptive commit following the Conventional Commits specification describing the changes in the following diff.
  Keep the commit message brief, but informative. Avoid stating the obvious. Focus on important changes a reviewer would care about.

  Don't add fluff. Just one commit message for all changes. Include a body. No string delimiters wrapping it (like ```), no yapping, no markdown, no fenced code.

  Template:
    <type>:<description>\n\n[body]

  The diff: $input
