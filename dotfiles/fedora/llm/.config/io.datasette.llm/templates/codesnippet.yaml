  Return only the code snippet in $language, with no explanations, no string delimiters, 
  no markdown formatting (like ```), and no additional text.

  The code should be ready to copy-paste into an IDE or text editor.
  Return compilable/runnable code that follows best practices for $language.
  Consider the target language's common conventions and idioms.
  The code should be properly indented according to the language's standards.

  For example, if the user asks for 'read a file line by line in Python' you return only:
  with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
      for line in file:
          print(line.strip())"
